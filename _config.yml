          Real Estate Market Trend Analysis: Identifying Cities with Declining Property Listing Prices.
        description: |
          This is a data analysis project where I acquired the data through web-scrapping and cleaned it with the python-pandas for the exploratory data analysis.
          
          Goal of this project was to identify the current market trends for better investment opportunities in housing, unaffordable housing situtaion and safe haven cities still showing promising trends.
          
          This allowed us to have discussion on the market sentiment backed by data instead of gut feel, which is really important.

          A machine learning model that can help predict the claims amoount of patient for the next fiscal year based on the past hitorical claims data as well as the prevailing health conditions.

          We have leveraged the data available for patients last 4 year claims, his/her age, precondition with severity level such as Hyper Tension, High Blood pressure and Diabetes. 

          We were able to leverage the EDA to understand the corelation and importance of certain information with the claims amount and based on that we decided to do the feature engineeing and build a decision treee based LGBMRegresssor model, which was able to predict the claims with the mean absolute error of approx 700.
          Its an ongoing process and we will further do the missing data, model testing and more model changes to further the models performance to make it more fast and lean, with less mean absolute error.

          Predicting Used Car prices
        description: |
          <strong>Ranked 179 on public and 390 on private leaderboard on Kaggle amount 4000 entries.</strong>

          I developed a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on features such as brand, model, engine, mileage, fuel type, color, and accident history. 
          
          This was part of a Kaggle project where I utilized an LLM-generated dataset and tested multiple models, ultimately identifying an ensemble of LGBMRegressor and CatBoost as the best performers. 
          The project involved extensive data preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection, along with hyperparameter tuning using the AUTOGLUON library. 
          
          To further reduce RMSE, I implemented a weighted ensemble method, combining the predictions from both models. This project provided valuable experience in advanced modeling techniques.

          I developed a machine learning model to predict if mushroom is poisonous or edible based on the stem root, flower size, fin size. 
          
          This was part of a Kaggle project where I utilized an LLM-generated dataset and tested multiple models, ultimately LGBMClassifier with best hypertunning parameters.

        description: |
          During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
          also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
          workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
          of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.

          For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
          600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <mark>Symfony</mark> to provide a backend API and
          <mark>Backbone</mark> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> to provide
          search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
          communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.

          Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company's devOps, this included managing
          our <mark>AWS</mark> infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spent time configuring and maintaining
          our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using <mark>AD FS</mark>, <mark>Shibboleth</mark> and
          <mark>CAS</mark> but also maintaining our software's SSO functionality.

          I was asked to update an existing Android app to the latest version of Android and to fix any issues caused by
          this as well as a few other existing issues. This project had a very tight time scale and I was able to complete
          it in very good time while providing regular updates to the client.

          While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
          enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
          At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
          such as <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>Gulp</mark>. I also worked on a number of <mark>iOS</mark> and
          <mark>Android</mark> applications.

          During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
          also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
          developer.

          During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
          great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
          team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.

          I started working for GWS Media part time during my third year at University and continued full time once I had
          graduated. It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over
          the past 3 years. Whilst at GWS I had the opportunity to work with:
          <mark>Drupal</mark>, <mark>Magento</mark>, <mark>Bootstrap</mark>, <mark>Codeigniter</mark>, <mark>Android</mark> and <mark>iOS</mark>.

          I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me
          the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.

          During my degree at Bristol University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although
          we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to
          my advantage in my day to day work.

          While at Bristol Uni I spent a lot of my free time with the Kitesurfing society. I spent 3 years on the committee
          as a secretary, trip rep and then media and promotions manager. During this time I took on roles from organising
          transport and designing posters to organising a trip to Portugal for over 30 students.

      When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as
      mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like
      rock climbing and playing some rugby. I currently have 2 horses and find this is a great way to get out of the house
      and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.

      I'm interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but
      I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if
      you would like to take a look - [jameswgrant](https://www.instagram.com/jameswgrant/).

      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of
      Bristol's indoor climbing centres or down 'The Rec' supporting Bath Rugby.
